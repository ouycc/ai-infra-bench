# Docker build and baseline validation

> This task is **CPU** (`environment_profile = "cpu"`, `gpus = 0`,
> `accelerator = "CPU"`). No GPU is needed to build or to reproduce the
> baseline. Any GPU-specific commands in older revisions of this file were
> incorrect for this task and have been removed.

## Target

- Image tag (versioned): `ai-infra-bench/vllm-pr-30475:v1.2.1-remediate-20260904T165410Z`
- Canonical candidate tag:
  `ghcr.io/ouycc/ai-infra-bench-task-envs:vllm-pr-30475-ea49c23e150d3c530749d845b4ad298694b05a2788648d54d921082a27d950c3`
  where the suffix is the `<env-key>` from
  `task_ci.py env-key --task vllm-pr-30475 --platform linux/amd64`.
- Image ID: `sha256:7f384099c16e399c1d0675753aa6ac64b3ff408e6089dfcc1dbd5be27e541841`
- Base image: `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.11.2@sha256:47a9896f86818fea323b2d38082758c62d9a0155d6fe6c4dbd7d735c556f680a`

The authoritative image identity is `environment/image-manifest.json`
(`image_id`, `image_tag`); the values above are mirrored from it.

Set the Docker endpoint explicitly for every command (the build host uses an
isolated daemon):

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///data/docker-bench/docker.sock
export DOCKER_CONFIG=/data/yinchen/docker-config
```

## Commands

The baseline reproducer and runtime smoke script are curator-only tools kept
under `validation/curator-tools/`; they are **not** in the image build context
and are never baked into the image. No agent-visible public test suite ships in
the image. The curator mounts the reproducer read-only at run time:

```bash
docker run --rm --network none \
  -v "$PWD/validation/curator-tools/reproduce_baseline.py:/tmp/reproduce_baseline.py:ro" \
  <image-ref> \
  python3 -I /tmp/reproduce_baseline.py
```

## Build

The `environment/` Dockerfile builds the image. Its first stage fetches the
exact Base commit and its real parent history, so the build needs a source of
the full git history. On this host `github.com` git smart-HTTP is not reachable
directly and the only egress proxy EOFs on the large history pack, so the build
was run on the isolated bench daemon with the legacy builder
(`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`, `--network host`) and `VLLM_REPOSITORY` pointed at a local
git-daemon serving the full, content-verified upstream history. No credential is
written to the image, git tree, or evidence.

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build --network host --no-cache \
  --build-arg VLLM_REPOSITORY="git://127.0.0.1:9418/vllm-hist.git" \
  -f environment/Dockerfile \
  -t ai-infra-bench/vllm-pr-30475:v1.2.1-remediate-20260904T165410Z \
  environment
```

The pytest wheels and the vLLM source archive are SHA-256-checked inside the
Dockerfile (`ac774fb6...30240624` for the source tarball). The source archive
is pulled from `codeload.github.com`, which is reachable directly; only the
git-history stage needs the local mirror. Provenance is asserted by in-image
content (see below), so the substituted history URL does not affect it.

## Results

Rebuilt and validated on 2026-09-05 (task v1.2.1, CPU); see
`environment/image-manifest.json` for the authoritative record.

### Build result

docker inspect Size: 15924622802 bytes
base image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.11.2@sha256:47a9896f86818fea323b2d38082758c62d9a0155d6fe6c4dbd7d735c556f680a
```

The image was built on the isolated bench daemon with the legacy builder
(`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`, `--network host`). The git-history stage's
`VLLM_REPOSITORY` was pointed at a local git-daemon serving the full,
content-verified upstream history because the host's only GitHub egress (proxy)
EOFs on the large pack; provenance is asserted by in-image content
(HEAD==base_commit, tree match, `rev-list>1`, not shallow, Oracle absent, clean
tree), so the substituted source URL does not affect provenance. `codeload` and
`files.pythonhosted.org` were fetched directly.

### Git provenance (verified in-image by `image-check`)

The `environment/Dockerfile` fetches the exact Base commit and its real parent
history from GitHub (there is **no** synthetic single commit). `image-check`
confirmed inside the image:

- `HEAD` == Base commit `676db55eecf8b6d9ec38ea243cf6f35ea8378ec6`;
- Git tree `aafa39e6544cbeaf83b72985f83aaefd4e9e3456`;
- real parent history (`git rev-list --count HEAD` = 12285, > 1);
- no remotes, no tags, no reflog, no `FETCH_HEAD`/`ORIG_HEAD`/`shallow`;
- working tree clean; `git fsck` clean; Oracle/future commit
  `f5f51e5931ffd99afe69696b60765b88d3eb13f2` absent;
- no `/tests`, `/solution`, `/validation` in the image;
- `vllm` and `vllm._C` both resolve under `/app`.

### Baseline reproduction

The minimal reproducer uses production vLLM classes, not a reimplementation.
It creates a sparse placeholder with `P=100` decoder positions and `E=8`
embedding rows, then supplies an encoder-cache capacity of 8. The base should
accept it under embedding-unit semantics, but instead rejects it. Run with the
reproducer mounted read-only (it is not baked into the image):

```json
{"baseline_bug_reproduced": true, "cache_capacity": 8, "can_allocate": false, "embedding_rows_E": 8, "expected_fixed_semantics": true, "placeholder_positions_P": 100}
```

This is a stable structural reproduction of the PR's resource-accounting bug;
it requires neither a model nor a dataset. It does not by itself validate the
full task verifier (the Harbor control cases and stability rounds do that).

### Residual risk

Native extensions (`*.so`, `_version.py`) are overlaid from the nearest
digest-pinned official v0.11.2 release rather than rebuilt from base SHA
`676db55e`. The PR's implementation surface is Python-only and the final image
passes source/native import checks, so this is a deliberate simplification for
Dockerfile synthesis. A task that changes native code must instead rebuild
extensions from the exact base source and lock the native build inputs.

### Network note

`github.com` (git smart-HTTP) is not reachable directly from the build host and
the only egress proxy EOFs on the large history pack, so the git-history stage
reads from a local git-daemon mirror serving the full, content-verified upstream
history (no credential is persisted in the image, git tree, or evidence). The
vLLM source archive and pytest wheels come from `codeload.github.com` /
`files.pythonhosted.org`, which are reachable directly and SHA-256-checked
inside the Dockerfile.
